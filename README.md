## 💼 Featured Project: End-to-End BI Solution for "Bode do Nô"

This project showcases my ability to architect a complete BI solution from the ground up for a major regional restaurant, transforming their operational data into a strategic asset.

### The Challenge: Data Chaos and Missed Opportunities
The restaurant's management operated with fragmented data. Sales information from in-house Point-of-Sale (POS) systems and third-party delivery platforms (like iFood) was siloed. This made it impossible to get a unified view of performance, leading to decisions based on intuition rather than evidence.

### My Solution: Architecting a Single Source of Truth
As the lead Data & BI Analyst, I engineered a full-cycle data solution to centralize information and deliver actionable insights.

**1. Automated Data Ingestion & ETL Pipeline:**
* I developed custom **Python scripts** to automatically extract raw sales data from diverse sources, completely eliminating hours of manual data compilation and the risk of human error.
* I implemented robust data cleaning, validation, and standardization logic using **Pandas** to handle inconsistencies (e.g., standardizing product names like "Coca-Cola" vs. "Coca ks").

**2. Centralized Data Modeling:**
* I designed and deployed a **PostgreSQL** database to serve as the central data warehouse.
* I structured the data into a relational model, creating a **Single Source of Truth** that consolidated sales, product, and customer metrics from all channels. This became the reliable foundation for all future analysis.

**3. Business-Driven KPI Development & Analysis:**
* Collaborating with stakeholders, I identified and defined critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that were previously untrackable, such as:
    * Sales performance by channel (In-house vs. Delivery).
    * Product profitability and combo analysis.
    * Peak sales hours and day-of-week performance trends.
    * Average ticket size evolution across different platforms.

**4. Interactive Dashboarding with BIMachine:**
* Using **BIMachine**, I built a suite of dynamic, interactive dashboards tailored for the management team.
* These dashboards provided a holistic view of the business, allowing executives to drill down into specifics, filter by date, product, or channel, and uncover insights independently. The solution moved them from static reports to dynamic data exploration.

### Business Impact & Value Delivered
* **Enabled Data-Driven Strategy:** Management can now accurately analyze which products sell best on which platform, optimize menu pricing, and adjust staffing based on predictable peak hours.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced manual reporting efforts by over **95%**, freeing up staff to focus on customer service and growth initiatives.
* **Increased Profitability:** Identified underperforming items and high-margin product combinations, providing clear data to guide marketing promotions and inventory management, directly impacting the bottom line.
* **A Scalable Foundation:** The system I built is not a one-off report; it's a scalable data infrastructure ready to incorporate new data sources as the business grows.

**Project Tech Stack:** `Python (Pandas)`, `SQL (PostgreSQL)`, `BIMachine`
